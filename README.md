**_Make New Jersey proud._**

A barebones Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/) that will tell you the closest NJ Turnpike exit to your home. That way, when someone says "What exit?", you can respond intelligently.

This is the first time I've ever worked on a web app--we'll see how it turns out!
