# myexit

A barebones Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/) that will tell you the closest Turnpike exit to your home. That way, when someone says "What exit?", you can respond intelligently.

I'm going to try and hack together something to do this within the structure of Heroku's article, [Getting Started with Node on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).

This is the first time I've ever worked on a web app--we'll see how it turns out!
